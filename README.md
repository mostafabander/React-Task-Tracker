# React Task Tracker
This is a simple react app that creates a list of tasks along with their times and reminders for them, which uses a db.json as a mock server so the changes are saved and persist. I used this repo to learn more reactJS from Traversy Media's crash course video found here: https://youtu.be/w7ejDZ8SWv8
